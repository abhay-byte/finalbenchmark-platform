# Feature Implementation Workflow

## Basic Rules

1. **Request**: You will tell me to implement a feature.
2. **Analysis**: I will analyze how to implement the requested feature.
3. **Implementation**: I will make the necessary changes and create the feature.
4. **Review**: You will review what I have created.
5. **Approval**: 
   - If you like the implementation, you will green light the changes.
   - If you don't like the implementation, you will ask for changes to be made.
6. **Testing**: I will always implement and run the app to verify the feature works correctly, then ask if the feature is correctly implemented.
7. **Commit**: Once approved, I will commit the changes to GitHub.

## Process

- I will wait for your feature request
- I will implement the feature following best practices
- I will test the feature in the running application
- I will await your feedback before committing any changes

Version 0.4 - Matrix Multiplication Algorithm Overhaul

• Implemented Strassen's divide-and-conquer matrix multiplication algorithm
• O(n^2.807) complexity for improved performance consistency
• Fresh random data generated for each benchmark iteration
• Adjusted workload parameters for all device tiers
• Fixed benchmark caching issues for more accurate results

Technical Changes:
• Matrix sizes automatically padded to power of 2 for Strassen's algorithm
• Threshold of 64 for fallback to standard multiplication
• Unique random seeds per iteration to prevent data reuse
• Updated iteration counts for Budget, MidRange, and Flagship tiers

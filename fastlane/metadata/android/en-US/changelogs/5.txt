v0.5

Performance Improvements:
- Optimized matrix multiplication for better multicore scaling (350% → 750% CPU utilization)
- Added thermal stabilization delays between benchmarks to prevent throttling

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed memory allocation bottleneck in matrix multiplication algorithm
- Adjusted JSON parsing iterations for consistent test duration across device tiers
- Fixed delete functionality for history benchmarks (now properly deletes from database)
- Consolidated ResultScreen to handle both fresh and history benchmark results

Code Quality:
- Centralized SCORING_FACTORS to KotlinBenchmarkManager (single source of truth)
- Removed duplicate HistoryDetailScreen (now uses ResultScreen for all results)
- Refactored CpuComparisonScreen to use centralized scoring factors
